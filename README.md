# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

A machine learning-powered Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies similar to a user's favorite movie using a **Content-Based Filtering** approach.

The project covers the complete workflow from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model building and deployment through an interactive web application.

## Recommendation Technique

The recommendation engine uses **Content-Based Filtering**.

The following movie features are combined:

- Genres
- Keywords
- Cast
- Director
- Overview

The combined textual features are transformed using **CountVectorizer**, and **Cosine Similarity** is used to identify movies with similar characteristics.

## Future Improvements

- User Authentication
- Collaborative Filtering
- Hybrid Recommendation System
- Movie Ratings
- Watchlist Feature
- Personalized Recommendations
- Dark Mode
